    <h1>Pantry app blog</h1>
    <p>
      I'm
      <a
        href="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/devlog/home.html?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjg10.solidcommunity.net%2Fdevlog%2Fnow.ttl%23Pantry"

      on a pantry app. I want to use recipes compatible with
      <a href="https://umai.noeldemartin.com">Umai</a>, but connected with a
      record of what ingredients are in the house. I have a more or less
      functional version that I've started using in my home. It's rough around
      the edges and I keep thinking of new functionality that would improve its
      usability. But that's a key part of why I've built it the way I have - the
      idea of enabling user control over both their data and the interfaces used
      to interact with it. Rather than simply sharing my current version, this
      blog will break it down and built it back up, step by step.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, this blog and app will include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep track of groceries within one or more locations

    <h2 id="part1">Part 1: Showing a recipe</h2>
    <small>Updated 3 Mar 2025</small>
    <p>
      My starting point is compatibility with the recipe app
      <a href="https://umai.noeldemartin.com">Umai</a>. It uses
      <a href="https://schema.org/Recipe"> schema.org Recipe objects</a>. As
      presented by <i>Practical Solid</i>, it's already possible to simply
      <a href="https://tube.tchncs.de/w/byuLJ8ybMB1ynUg6sbTdhB"
        >view and add to a recipe in the PodOS browser</a
      >. Because we'll be integrating with pantry data, we want to go one step
      further and create a custom interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're going to start with
      <a href="https://github.com/pod-os/PodOS/tree/main/elements"
        >PodOS elements</a
      >. We create a plain HTML file, in this case hosted on a Solid pod, using
      a set of web components to access the recipe data. Additionally, we'll
      autoload some additional experimental web components that provide rough
      editing capabilities and allow the use of prefixes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="01/app.html">app</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="01/rosti.ttl">data</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Starting from the recipe itself, <code>pos-picture</code> is used to fetch
      a known picture (here using <code>schema:image</code>) and a name is
      accessed using <code>property="schema:name"</code>. The intention is for
      this UI data binding to work similar to
      <a href="https://mavo.io">Mavo</a>.
    </p>
    <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code class="language-html">
&lt;pos-resource
    uri="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/01/rosti.ttl#it"
    prefix="schema: https://schema.org/"
&gt;
    &lt;pos-picture>&lt;/pos-picture>
    &lt;h2>
        &lt;my-editable-literal property="schema:name">
        &lt;/my-editable-literal>
    &lt;/h2>
&lt;/pos-resource>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Ingredients and instructions are slightly more complex. An experimental
      list web component is used that iterates through instructions ordered by
      their <code>schema:position</code> and displays each item using a
      template.
    </p>
    <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code class="language-html">
&lt;my-list 
    property="schema:recipeInstructions" 
    sort="schema:position"
>
    &lt;template name="item">
        &lt;li>
          &lt;my-editable-literal property="schema:text">
          &lt;/my-editable-literal>
        &lt;/li>
    &lt;/template>
&lt;/my-list>
    </code></pre>
    <h2 id="part2">Part 2: Browsing recipes and beyond</h2>
    <small>Updated 5 Mar 2025</small>
    <p>
      In part 1, the app only opens a single resource. We want to be able to
      open multiple recipes but also different types of objects. To support an
      open world assumption, we want to be able to handle unknown types too.
    </p>
    <p>
      We add a navigation bar, and use
      <code>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/pod-os/PodOS/tree/main/elements/src/components/pos-type-router"
          >pos-type-router</a
        >
      </code>
      as a generic component to display arbitrary resources.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="02/app.html">app</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Client side routing is implemented using the PodOS
      <code
        ><a
          href="https://github.com/pod-os/PodOS/tree/main/elements/src/components/pos-router"
          >pos-router</a
        ></code
      >
      component. We listen for a <code>pod-os:route-changed</code> event after
      navigating to e.g.,
      <code>https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/02/</code>, and update
      the uri on <code>pos-resource</code>, which causes the new uri to load -
      in this case showing the contents of the container.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than adding complexity within the app, we can split out the recipe
      as a separate "pane". We use an experimental conditional rendering
      component to display the recipe pane for
      <code>schema:Recipe</code> objects, and display
      <code>pos-type-router</code> otherwise.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;show-if if-else>
    &lt;template if-typeof="schema:Recipe" src="recipe.html">
    &lt;/template>
    &lt;template else>
        &lt;pos-type-router>&lt;/pos-type-router>
    &lt;/template>
&lt;/show-if>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      The recipe pane is dynamically loaded from
      <a href="02/recipe.html">recipe.html</a>. It's the same HTML code that we
      used in part 1 - the file is a HTML fragment using web components that
      receive access to a PodOS instance and a resource via events. I've made a
      first attempt at a
      <a
        href="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/open-with/databrowser-open-with.html#pane-class-podos-compatible-panes"
        >spec</a
      >
      for PodOS-compatible panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      An advantage of having a separate recipe pane is that we can reuse it in
      other contexts. This potentially includes the pod browser itself, in the
      form of a dynamically registered pane. Using a proof of concept
      <code>registered-pane</code> and a demo type registry, we have:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="02/browser.html"> browser app </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="02/prefs.ttl"> registry data </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As specified by the same draft
      <a
        href="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/open-with/databrowser-open-with.html"
        >spec</a
      >, panes and external apps are specified as part of a type registration.
      The browser app uses an experimental
      <code>registered-pane</code> component to load the pane, and
      <code>open-with</code> component to provide a menu that allows the user to
      open the recipe in
      <a
        href="https://umai.noeldemartin.com/viewer?url=https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/02/rosti.ttl%23it"
      >
        Umai Viewer </a
      >. The browser app itself doesn't know about recipes, but the type
      registry does, which allows it to show our custom pane.

    <small>Published 7 Mar 2025. Last updated 12 Mar 2025</small>
    <br />
    <details>
      <summary>Changes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          12 Mar 2025: add clarification of <code>pantry:</code> namespace
        </li>
        <li>
          12 Mar 2025: use
          <code>schema:name</code>
          instead of
          <code>rdfs:label</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <p>In this part, we're going to add the features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define groceries [...]</li>
      <li>Edit the approximate quantity of a grocery [...]</li>
      <li>Annotate recipes to note which groceries are required</li>
      <li>List recipes using the grocery as an ingredient.</li>
      <li>See whether the ingredients for a recipe are available</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To do this, we need to go beyond Umai's data model. We'll reuse other
      existing vocabularies where we can. Where new terms are needed, we'll use
      the
      <code>pantry:</code> prefix, mapped to
      <code>https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/terms.ttl#</code>. The
      general philosophy here is to not allow missing terms to get in the way of
      experimentation - minting new terms is trivially easy. If a set of terms
      turns out to be of high value, they can then be formally documented, and
      at that point a
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">permanent</a> home can be
      found. In the mean time, interoperability will still need to be
      considered. We'll return to this later.
    </p>
    <h3>Groceries</h3>
    <p>
      A grocery will be a
      <code>schema:Product</code>. We'll define a new predicate for approximate
      quantity of a grocery and named individuals
      <code> None, Low, Some, Many </code>
      .
    </p>
    <pre><code>
:1638629734460861 a schema:Product; 
schema:name "Potatoes"; 
pantry:approxQuantity pantry:None.
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      We'll store all products in a pantry document. Dereferencing the pantry
      document will return all the known products in one go. This is primarily a
      performance based
      <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2022/12/30/lets-talk-about-pods/"
        >document box</a
      >. We want to be able to load information about all groceries in a single
      request. When we load or navigate to the pantry document, we want to know
      that's what we're looking at, so we give it a class. There's no predicate
      linking the pantry document to individual products because it's just a
      view of the underlying graph. One day Solid might allow such a view to be
      dynamically generated from a hybrid graph.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
<> a pantry:Pantry.
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      We'll create new panes for a <code>pantry:Pantry</code> and
      <code>schema:Product</code>. We'll keep them simple and add more features
      later. The same panes can be used in the data browser, so we add them in
      the registry too.

    </figure>
    <p>
      The pantry pane offers the user the option to add a new grocery just by
      giving it a name, which can also be edited later. Creating the grocery
      involves adding several triples to a specific document, so we do this with
      an experimental wrapper around a form. The pantry document uri is
      hard-coded here. This works fine for a user creating a custom interface,
      but we'll need to generalise this later for anybody else to use the app.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form
    typeof="schema:Product"
    doc="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/03/pantry.ttl"
>
    &lt;input property="schema:name" />
    &lt;input type="submit" value="New" />
&lt;/form>
      </code></pre>
    <figure>
      <img src="03/product.png" style="max-width:300px" />
      <figcaption>Product pane</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The product pane uses an experimental classifier web component inspired by
      <a
        href="https://solidos.github.io/solid-ui/Documentation/forms-intro.html"
        >SolidOS <code>ui:Classifier</code></a
      >. The web component dereferences
      <code>pantry:ProductApproxQuantity</code> and offers the user to select
      from instances of that class.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;my-classifier
      label="Quantity:"
      property="pantry:approxQuantity"
      category="pantry:ProductApproxQuantity"
>&lt;/my-classifier>
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      The product pane loads recipes that use that grocery. To do this, we need
      to link groceries and recipes.
    </p>
    <h3>Annotating recipes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="03/app.html">app with recipe pane</a></li>
      <li><a href="03/recipe.html">recipe pane</a></li>
      <li><a href="03/supplies.ttl">supplies document</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's a long standing issue that
      <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/882"
        ><code>schema:recipeIngredient</code> does not support structured
        data</a
      >, which is perhaps also understandable given the need to cover such cases
      as "1kg/ 2 lb potatoes (skin on weight) ( - Aus: Sebago (dirt brushed),
      US: Yukon Gold, Russet, UK: Maris Piper, King Edwards (Note 1))". The
      solution we'll pick is to use
      <a href="https://schema.org/supply"><code>schema:supply</code></a
      >. We can use the same label, but be specific about the grocery item and
      even specify the order of ingredients using <code>schema:position</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
:1741337498953
    schem:item &lt;pantry.ttl#1638629734460861>;
    schem:name
        "1kg/ 2 lb potatoes (skin on weight) ( - Aus: Sebago (dirt brushed), US: Yukon Gold, Russet, UK: Maris Piper, King Edwards (Note 1))";
    schem:position "1".
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      But Umai (and most websites with structured recipe data) use
      <code>schema:recipeIngredient</code> and not <code>schema:supply</code>.
      What we're going to do is use both predicates and keep them in sync. We're
      going to start by doing it the low tech way - we're going to show both
      sets of data and the user will visually ensure that they match. A second
      solution would be to sync them using
      <a href="https://spectra.video/w/fAjm253YiF9aEch4stYUHQ">CRDTs</a>, as
      already used by Umai - a change in one of the predicates would be
      accompanied by a change in the other. We'll explore a third solution
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      With our low tech solution, the user autocompletes ingredients from the
      groceries defined in the pantry document. In this example, I don't
      actually care what type of potatoes are needed - and if I do I can return
      to the recipe to check. Similarly, I'm opting to substitute normal butter
      instead of ghee. I haven't annotated vegetable oil, salt or pepper because
      I always have them in the house. I've progressively enhanced the text
      descriptions with structured data only for parts I care about, and I'm
      using a pantry defined at the granularity that I want as the point of
      truth rather than one provided by others.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="03/recipe.png" style="max-width:300px" />
      <figcaption>
        We can now annotate recipes to note which groceries are required.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Because the pantry document provides information about all groceries at
      once, the recipe pane can load that document and show that I have no
      potatoes and lots of butter. It also provides links to those groceries to
      be able to take more actions that involve them. If I decide later that I
      do sometimes want to buy and use ghee instead of butter, I could also add
      it as a grocery, link it to the recipe here and see the availability of
      both the preferred ingredient and its potential substitute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autocomplete is implemented with an experimental component with a similar
      interface to the classifier. All loaded instances of
      <code>schema:Product</code> are suggested. If <code>category</code> is
      missing, then all known objects of <code>schema:item</code> are used
      instead.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;autocomplete-input
    property="schema:item"
    category="schema:Product"
>&lt;/autocomplete-input>
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      How is this data used in the product pane? By default, the
      <code>schema:supply</code> statements would be saved in the same document
      as the recipe. We override this to instead save them in a supplies
      document. This acts as an index of recipes by ingredient to avoid needing
      to load all recipes. An alternative would be to use a local first approach
      (like Umai) and have all recipes at hand. The two approaches could
      co-exist as long as the index is updated when recipe documents are
      modified.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;my-list
    property="schema:supply"
    sort="schema:position"
    add-new
    doc="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/03/supplies.ttl"
>
          </code></pre>
    <p>
      Returning to the product pane - providing a list of recipes that use an
      ingredient involves loading the supplies document, iterating through the
      HowToSupply objects that use the ingredient, and loading the name of the
      corresponding recipe.
    </p>
    <h3>Cooperative interoperability</h3>
    <p>
      On the whole, this style of development is strongly tied to navigating a
      knowledge graph, with deliberate dereferencing of documents at key
      locations in the rendering process. It's unlikely to achieve
      <a href="https://spectra.video/w/1iGJJhQJLcajs5W5DZZ2Qz"
        >interoperable serendipity</a
      >, but we can still explicitly communicate the data structures that we use
      to enable others to interoperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I'm working in a particular domain, e.g., food, and I want to
      interoperate with other apps, e.g., Umai, I might ask: what data
      structures can I use? To begin with, I might want to be more precise
    </p>
    <style>
      th { text-align: left}
    </style>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Umai v0.1.8</th>
        <th>Pantry app part 3</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with recipes</td>
        <td>x</td>
        <td>x</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with records of pantry contents</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>x</td>
      </tr>
      <td>Works with shopping lists</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </table>
    <p>
      Within apps that work with recipes, we can talk about different classes
      and shapes.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Umai v0.1.8</th>
        <th>Pantry app part 3</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with schema:Recipe</td>
        <td>x</td>
        <td>x</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with Umai v0.1.8 data shape</td>
        <td>x</td>
        <td>x</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with schema:supply</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>x</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Works with
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/food-ontology#Recipe"
            >fo:Recipe</a
          >
        </td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Similar to how web browser support tables work for https://caniuse.com,
      developer and data power-users gradually get the feeling for which data
      structures are supported by the most apps or by the apps one wants to use.
      Efficiently organising app compatibility data is something we'll have to
      come back to...
    </p>
    <h2 id="part4">Part 4: What can I cook? What do I need to buy?</h2>
    <small>Updated 17 Mar 2025</small>
    <p>
      So far we've covered the first two of the four planned ways of using
      pantry data with recipes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>List recipes using the grocery as an ingredient.</li>
      <li>See whether the ingredients for a recipe are available</li>
      <li>
        List recipes including which ingredients need to be bought, separating
        out staples from special ingredients
      </li>
      <li>
        See what groceries need to be used and what recipes might use them
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The latter are arguably more important as they allow a quick scan across
      recipes and ingredients. We'll also define locations of groceries to help
      scan them in chunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We introduce two new subclasses <code>pantry:Staple</code> and
      <code>pantry:Perishable</code>. Staples are usually available. Perishables
      need to be used when they are available. Groceries will be linked to a
      location with a new predicate <code>pantry:contains</code>. We adjust the
      product pane and pantry pane, and add new location and cookbook panes.
    </p>
    <h3>Product pane</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="04/app.html?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjg10.solidcommunity.net%2Fpantry%2Fblog%2F04%2Fpantry.ttl%231638629734460861"
          >app with product pane</a
        >
      </li>
      <li><a href="04/product.html">product pane</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The changes to the product pane are minimal. We'll allow for editing of
      the location of the product with a new experimental web component that
      also allows specifying a link and a label.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;my-editable-link rev="pantry:contains">&lt;/my-editable-link>
      </code></pre>
    <p>For potatoes, providing a new link and label for location yields:</p>
    <pre><code>
:Cellar 
  rdfs:label "Cellar"; 
  pantry:contains :1638629734460861 .
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      The statements are by default inserted in the same document as the subject
      (potatoes), treating location information as part of the pantry itself,
      which suits us fine for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll also add an <code>autocomplete-input</code> component to select
      types. We haven't defined a category to use, so it will just autocomplete
      all known types. The first time we use it, it won't know about
      <code>pantry:Perishable</code>, but we can just paste the URI in anyway -
      the component is designed with an open world assumption in mind. The
      autocomplete is not the nicest UX to specify a type but it's easy to add
      to the UI and functional for a fairly infrequent task. Potatoes are marked
      as perishable, and butter as a staple. The latter doesn't need to be
      marked as perishable - it consistently gets used before its best-before
      date.
    </p>
    <h3>Pantry pane</h3>
    <p>
      The pantry pane gets a major upgrade. It now consists of six lists using
      <code>my-list</code>, <code>show-if</code> conditional rendering, and
      other display web components. We also add a reusable
      <code>product-row.html</code> HTML fragment.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="04/pantry.png" style="max-width:300px" />
      <figcaption>Pantry pane</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This screenshot shows that we've got (lots of) potatoes that need to be
      used. Following the link will show the product pane with the list of
      recipes. We usually have butter in the house but don't at the moment. An
      inline <code>my-classifier</code> is provided in case the data is out of
      date. We have links to each location (to be shown in location pane), and
      we still have the full list of defined groceries in the pantry. Obviously
      minimal effort has gone into styling - emphasis is still on prototyping a
      MVP at this stage.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="04/app.html?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjg10.solidcommunity.net%2Fpantry%2Fblog%2F03%2Fpantry.ttl"
          >app with pantry pane</a

      <li><a href="04/pantry.ttl">pantry document</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Location pane</h3>
    <p>
      We're going to model locations with the SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample,
      and Actuator) ontology as
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAFeatureOfInterest"
        >sosa:FeatureOfInterest</a
      >. At some point we might want to use a subclass, but given the bespoke,
      experimental nature of the app, for the time being we want to reduce
      friction to getting started. Treating a location as a feature of interest
      means that we'll be able to define observable properties and record
      changes in those properties over time. This provides a point of
      integration with potential digital home apps that aim to provide a digital
      twin of the home. We'll be able to talk about not just what is in the
      fridge, but also its electricity usage, maintenance and entire lifecycle
      as a consumer good. In contrast to ingredients, which are ephemeral, a
      fridge or cupboard is a continuing feature of a home. If we replace the
      fridge, we'd create a new <code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code> and move
      relevant groceries into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the time being, the main effect of this decision is that we register
      the location pane with the <code>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</code> class and
      keep in mind that its ultimate scope may be much broader than simply
      listing groceries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The location pane itself is relatively straight-forward, iterating through
      the <code>pantry:contains</code> objects and displaying them with the
      <code>product-row.html</code>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="04/app.html?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjg10.solidcommunity.net%2Fpantry%2Fblog%2F04%2Fpantry.ttl%23Cellar"
          >app with location pane</a
        >
      </li>
      <li><a href="04/location.html">location pane</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cookbook pane</h3>
    <p>
      As a first pass, the cookbook view will simply show whether the
      ingredients for each recipe are available. We'll split out the staples
      because they will appear frequently and are usually assumed to be in the
      house.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="04/cookbook.png" style="max-width:300px" />
      <figcaption>Cookbook pane</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Implementation is again with the list and conditional rendering
      components, and reusing the <code>product-row.html</code> fragment. One
      difficulty arises - the panes need to know about and load the supplies
      document and pantry document in addition to the recipe (names) themselves.
      For the time being, these are hardcoded in the pane itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an implementation note, Umai cookbooks are
      <a href="https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/umai/issues/19">currently</a>
      containers containing documents with <code>schema:Recipe</code> objects -
      they do not have their own class. Before dereferencing the recipe
      documents, the cookbook can be identified through its type index
      registration. This is supported in the app using an
      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/#paths">n3 resource path</a>.
      Public recipe lists are <code>schema:ItemList</code>. The app supports
      both and the approach could be revisited in collaboration with Umai.
