    <p>
      I'm
      <a
        href="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/devlog/home.html?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjg10.solidcommunity.net%2Fdevlog%2Fnow.ttl%23Pantry"

      on a pantry app. I want to use recipes compatible with Umai, but connected
      with a record of what ingredients are in the house. I have a more or less
      functional version that I've started using in my home. It's rough around
      the edges and I keep thinking of new functionality that would improve its
      usability. But that's a key part of why I've built it the way I have - the
      idea of enabling user control over both their data and the interfaces used
      to interact with it. Rather than simply sharing my current version, this
      blog will break it down and built it back up, step by step.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, this blog and app will include:</p>
    <ul>

    <h2 id="part1">Part 1: Showing a recipe</h2>
    <small>Updated 3 Mar 2025</small>
    <p>
      My starting point is compatibility with the recipe app
      <a href="https://umai.noeldemartin.com">Umai</a>. It uses
      <a href="https://schema.org/Recipe"> schema.org Recipe objects</a>. As
      presented by <i>Practical Solid</i>, it's already possible to simply
      <a href="https://tube.tchncs.de/w/byuLJ8ybMB1ynUg6sbTdhB"
        >view and add to a recipe in the PodOS browser</a
      >. Because we'll be integrating with pantry data, we want to go one step
      further and create a custom interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're going to start with
      <a href="https://github.com/pod-os/PodOS/tree/main/elements"
        >PodOS elements</a
      >. We create a plain HTML file, in this case hosted on a Solid pod, using
      a set of web components to access the recipe data. Additionally, we'll
      autoload some additional experimental web components that provide rough
      editing capabilities and allow the use of prefixes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="01/app.html">app</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="01/rosti.ttl">data</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Starting from the recipe itself, <code>pos-picture</code> is used to fetch
      a known picture (here using <code>schema:image</code>) and a name is
      accessed using <code>property="schema:name"</code>. The intention is for
      this UI data binding to work similar to
      <a href="https://mavo.io">Mavo</a>.
    </p>
    <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code class="language-html">
&lt;pos-resource
    uri="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/01/rosti.ttl#it"
    prefix="schema: https://schema.org/"
&gt;
    &lt;pos-picture>&lt;/pos-picture>
    &lt;h2>
        &lt;my-editable-literal property="schema:name">
        &lt;/my-editable-literal>
    &lt;/h2>
&lt;/pos-resource>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Ingredients and instructions are slightly more complex. An experimental
      list web component is used that iterates through instructions ordered by
      their <code>schema:position</code> and displays each item using a
      template.
    </p>
    <pre style="overflow-x:auto"><code class="language-html">
&lt;my-list 
    property="schema:recipeInstructions" 
    sort="schema:position"
>
    &lt;template name="item">
        &lt;li>
          &lt;my-editable-literal property="schema:text">
          &lt;/my-editable-literal>
        &lt;/li>
    &lt;/template>
&lt;/my-list>
    </code></pre>
    <h2 id="part2">Part 2: Browsing recipes and beyond</h2>
    <small>Updated 5 Mar 2025</small>
    <p>
      In part 1, the app only opens a single resource. We want to be able to
      open multiple recipes but also different types of objects. To support an
      open world assumption, we want to be able to handle unknown types too.
    </p>
    <p>
      We add a navigation bar, and use
      <code>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/pod-os/PodOS/tree/main/elements/src/components/pos-type-router"
          >pos-type-router</a
        >
      </code>
      as a generic component to display arbitrary resources.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="02/app.html">app</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Client side routing is implemented using the PodOS
      <code
        ><a
          href="https://github.com/pod-os/PodOS/tree/main/elements/src/components/pos-router"
          >pos-router</a
        ></code
      >
      component. We listen for a <code>pod-os:route-changed</code> event after
      navigating to e.g.,
      <code>https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/02/</code>, and update
      the uri on <code>pos-resource</code>, which causes the new uri to load -
      in this case showing the contents of the container.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than adding complexity within the app, we can split out the recipe
      as a separate "pane". We use an experimental conditional rendering
      component to display the recipe pane for
      <code>schema:Recipe</code> objects, and display
      <code>pos-type-router</code> otherwise.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;show-if if-else>
    &lt;template if-typeof="schema:Recipe" src="recipe.html">
    &lt;/template>
    &lt;template else>
        &lt;pos-type-router>&lt;/pos-type-router>
    &lt;/template>
&lt;/show-if>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      The recipe pane is dynamically loaded from
      <a href="02/recipe.html">recipe.html</a>. It's the same HTML code that we
      used in part 1 - the file is a HTML fragment using web components that
      receive access to a PodOS instance and a resource via events. I've made a
      first attempt at a
      <a
        href="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/open-with/databrowser-open-with.html#pane-class-podos-compatible-panes"
        >spec</a
      >
      for PodOS-compatible panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      An advantage of having a separate recipe pane is that we can reuse it in
      other contexts. This potentially includes the pod browser itself, in the
      form of a dynamically registered pane. Using a proof of concept
      <code>registered-pane</code> and a demo type registry, we have:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="02/browser.html"> browser app </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="02/prefs.ttl"> registry data </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As specified by the same draft
      <a
        href="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/open-with/databrowser-open-with.html"
        >spec</a
      >, panes and external apps are specified as part of a type registration.
      The browser app uses an experimental
      <code>registered-pane</code> component to load the pane, and
      <code>open-with</code> component to provide a menu that allows the user to
      open the recipe in
      <a
        href="https://umai.noeldemartin.com/viewer?url=https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/02/rosti.ttl%23it"
      >
        Umai Viewer </a
      >. The browser app itself doesn't know about recipes, but the type
      registry does, which allows it to show our custom pane.

    <h2 id="part3">Part 3: Going beyond the Umai data model</h2>
    <small>Updated 7 Mar 2025</small>
    <p>In this part, we're going to add the features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define groceries [...]</li>
      <li>Edit the approximate quantity of a grocery [...]</li>
      <li>Annotate recipes to note which groceries are required</li>
      <li>List recipes using the grocery as an ingredient.</li>
      <li>See whether the ingredients for a recipe are available</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Groceries</h3>
    <p>
      To do this, we need to go beyond Umai's data model. A grocery will be a
      <code>schema:Product</code>. We'll define a new predicate for approximate
      quantity of a grocery and named individuals
      <code> None, Low, Some, Many </code>
      .
    </p>
    <pre><code>
:1638629734460861 a schema:Product; 
rdfs:label "Potatoes"; 
pantry:approxQuantity pantry:None.
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      We'll store all products in a pantry document. Dereferencing the pantry
      document will return all the known products in one go. This is primarily a
      performance based
      <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2022/12/30/lets-talk-about-pods/"
        >document box</a
      >. We want to be able to load information about all groceries in a single
      request. When we load or navigate to the pantry document, we want to know
      that's what we're looking at, so we give it a class. There's no predicate
      linking the pantry document to individual products because it's just a
      view of the underlying graph. One day Solid might allow such a view to be
      dynamically generated from a hybrid graph.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
<> a pantry:Pantry.
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      We'll create new panes for a <code>pantry:Pantry</code> and
      <code>schema:Product</code>. We'll keep them simple and add more features
      later. The same panes can be used in the data browser, so we add them in
      the registry too.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The pantry pane offers the user the option to add a new grocery just by
      giving it a name, which can also be edited later. Creating the grocery
      involves adding several triples to a specific document, so we do this with
      an experimental wrapper around a form. The pantry document uri is
      hard-coded here. This works fine for a user creating a custom interface,
      but we'll need to generalise this later for anybody else to use the app.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form
    typeof="schema:Product"
    doc="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/03/pantry.ttl"
>
    &lt;input property="rdfs:label" />
    &lt;input type="submit" value="New" />
&lt;/form>
      </code></pre>
    <figure>
      <img src="03/product.png" style="max-width:300px" />
      <figcaption>Product pane</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The product pane uses an experimental classifier web component inspired by
      <a
        href="https://solidos.github.io/solid-ui/Documentation/forms-intro.html"
        >SolidOS <code>ui:Classifier</code></a
      >. The web component dereferences
      <code>pantry:ProductApproxQuantity</code> and offers the user to select
      from instances of that class.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;my-classifier
      label="Quantity:"
      property="pantry:approxQuantity"
      category="pantry:ProductApproxQuantity"
>&lt;/my-classifier>
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      The product pane loads recipes that use that grocery. To do this, we need
      to link groceries and recipes.
    </p>
    <h3>Annotating recipes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="03/app.html">app with recipe pane</a></li>
      <li><a href="03/recipe.html">recipe pane</a></li>
      <li><a href="03/supplies.ttl">supplies document</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's a long standing issue that
      <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/882"
        ><code>schema:recipeIngredient</code> does not support structured
        data</a
      >, which is perhaps also understandable given the need to cover such cases
      as "1kg/ 2 lb potatoes (skin on weight) ( - Aus: Sebago (dirt brushed),
      US: Yukon Gold, Russet, UK: Maris Piper, King Edwards (Note 1))". The
      solution we'll pick is to use
      <a href="https://schema.org/supply"><code>schema:supply</code></a
      >. We can use the same label, but be specific about the grocery item and
      even specify the order of ingredients using <code>schema:position</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
:1741337498953
    schem:item &lt;pantry.ttl#1638629734460861>;
    schem:name
        "1kg/ 2 lb potatoes (skin on weight) ( - Aus: Sebago (dirt brushed), US: Yukon Gold, Russet, UK: Maris Piper, King Edwards (Note 1))";
    schem:position "1".
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      But Umai (and most websites with structured recipe data) use
      <code>schema:recipeIngredient</code> and not <code>schema:supply</code>.
      What we're going to do is use both predicates and keep them in sync. We're
      going to start by doing it the low tech way - we're going to show both
      sets of data and the user will visually ensure that they match. A second
      solution would be to sync them using
      <a href="https://spectra.video/w/fAjm253YiF9aEch4stYUHQ">CRDTs</a>, as
      already used by Umai - a change in one of the predicates would be
      accompanied by a change in the other. We'll explore a third solution
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      With our low tech solution, the user autocompletes ingredients from the
      groceries defined in the pantry document. In this example, I don't
      actually care what type of potatoes are needed - and if I do I can return
      to the recipe to check. Similarly, I'm opting to substitute normal butter
      instead of ghee. I haven't annotated vegetable oil, salt or pepper because
      I always have them in the house. I've progressively enhanced the text
      descriptions with structured data only for parts I care about, and I'm
      using a pantry defined at the granularity that I want as the point of
      truth rather than one provided by others.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="03/recipe.png" style="max-width:300px" />
      <figcaption>
        We can now annotate recipes to note which groceries are required.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Because the pantry document provides information about all groceries at
      once, the recipe pane can load that document and show that I have no
      potatoes and lots of butter. It also provides links to those groceries to
      be able to take more actions that involve them. If I decide later that I
      do sometimes want to buy and use ghee instead of butter, I could also add
      it as a grocery, link it to the recipe here and see the availability of
      both the preferred ingredient and its potential substitute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autocomplete is implemented with an experimental component with a similar
      interface to the classifier. All loaded instances of
      <code>schema:Product</code> are suggested. If <code>category</code> is
      missing, then all known objects of <code>schema:item</code> are used
      instead.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;autocomplete-input
    property="schema:item"
    category="schema:Product"
>&lt;/autocomplete-input>
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      How is this data used in the product pane? By default, the
      <code>schema:supply</code> statements would be saved in the same document
      as the recipe. We override this to instead save them in a supplies
      document. This acts as an index of recipes by ingredient to avoid needing
      to load all recipes. An alternative would be to use a local first approach
      (like Umai) and have all recipes at hand. The two approaches could
      co-exist as long as the index is updated when recipe documents are
      modified.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;my-list
    property="schema:supply"
    sort="schema:position"
    add-new
    doc="https://jg10.solidcommunity.net/pantry/blog/03/supplies.ttl"
>
          </code></pre>
    <p>
      Returning to the product pane - providing a list of recipes that use an
      ingredient involves loading the supplies document, iterating through the
      HowToSupply objects that use the ingredient, and loading the name of the
      corresponding recipe.
    </p>
    <h3>Cooperative interoperability</h3>

      On the whole, this style of development is strongly tied to navigating a
      knowledge graph, with deliberate dereferencing of documents at key
      locations in the rendering process. It's unlikely to achieve

        >interoperable serendipity</a
      >, but we can still explicitly communicate the data structures that we use
      to enable others to interoperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I'm working in a particular domain, e.g., food, and I want to
      interoperate with other apps, e.g., Umai, I might ask: what data
      structures can I use? To begin with, I might want to be more precise
    </p>
    <style>
      th { text-align: left}
    </style>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Umai v0.1.8</th>
        <th>Pantry app part 3</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with recipes</td>
        <td>x</td>
        <td>x</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with records of pantry contents</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>x</td>
      </tr>
      <td>Works with shopping lists</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>

      Within apps that work with recipes, we can talk about different classes
      and shapes.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Umai v0.1.8</th>
        <th>Pantry app part 3</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with schema:Recipe</td>
        <td>x</td>
        <td>x</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with Umai v0.1.8 data shape</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Works with schema:supply</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>x</td>

      <tr>

      Similar to how web browser support tables work for https://caniuse.com,
      developer and data power-users gradually get the feeling for which data
      structures are supported by the most apps or by the apps one wants to use.
      Efficiently organising app compatibility data is something we'll have to
      come back to...
